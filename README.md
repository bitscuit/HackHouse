# HackHouse

**Authors** : Michael Tanel, Henry Li, and Mitchell Mulder
## About
A live collaborative Todo list by hackers for hackers. This was a project developed during QHacks, at Queen's University. 
HackHouse is an Todo List for Android that uses the users Google id to signin to create private or collaborative Todo List that are live using Google Firebase.

## From the team
This app is still very much a work in progress as we only had thirty six hours during the hackathon to build this from scratch. 
However, we are proud of it's functionality in such little time, and we will continue to develop this at least until a minimum viable product level has been accomplished.

### TODO (Tentative)
1. Fix the crash when a new user firsts tries to sign in with their Google account.
2. Create a unique user id so to keep all todo lists private.
3. Improve the GUI (Lots that can be done here).
4. Possibly edit this repo to only have source code and no Android Studio IDE specific files.
